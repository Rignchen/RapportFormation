# Rustlings <Badge type="tip" text="Rust" />

When we started our first year as dev students, we were introduced to Rust.<br> 
The idea was that if we could learn Rust, we could learn any language.

To learn Rust, our "teacher" told us to do the [Rustlings](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings) exercises.<br>
We didn't had to make them, I personally had time to go to the 2nd exercise in the `option` section.

It was the first time I've seen a Rust code, and it was really interesting.<br>
During that I discovered rust's compiler errors, which are really helpful as
they tell you what's wrong and help you fix it.<br>

The way the exercises are made is that they give you a bunch of files and rustlings try to compile them, one by one until
it either finds a file that doesn't compile or it finds a file with a comment `// I AM NOT DONE` in it.<br>
It then prints the error code and let you fix it. It then detects that you've modified the file and tries to compile it again.<br>
Once the file compiles, it will greet you with a message, you can then remove the comment and go to the next exercise.
