# Ex Java <Badge type="tip" text="Java" />

After making the static website, our "teacher" wanted us to learn Java so he made [some exercises](https://github.com/Rignchen/ex_java_bastien) for us to do. 

These exercises were different from the ones we did in Rust as in Rust we were correcting mistakes in the code and in Java we had to implement the whole function so that it returns the expected result.

It was pretty easy to do as I already knew the basics of the Java language, I still had to learn how to use streams and I struggled a bit with the syntax, but I managed to do it in the end and at the end of it I took all the exercises back and remade them using streams.
