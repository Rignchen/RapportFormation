# Introduction

Hello I'm Rignchen, a swiss app dev student passionated in programmation.

I've been coding in mcfunction since I was 14 and learned python when I was 16<br>
I code for around 2-3 hours for fun and 7 hours for work, this number can go up to 12 hours during vacations.

I like strict and optimized languages, that's why my favorite language is rust.<br>
A contrario, I don't like languages like html or css wich are makeup and style languages

When I'll be older I would like to work as a game developper or a low-level developper
