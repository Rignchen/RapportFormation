# Introduction

Hello I'm Nils<Badge type="tip" text="she/her"/>, a swiss app dev apprentice passionated in programmation.

I've been coding in mcfunction since I was 14 and learned python when I was 16.\
I've started to learn python in high school and enjoyed writing lines of code, that's why I descided to start an apprenticeship as developper.

When I was at jobtrek I coded for 7 hours a day and around 2-3 hours at home.\
Since I'm at bobst I code for 8 hours a day but because of the longer travel time I don't have much time to code at home\
During my vacation I can easily sit in front of my computer for 12 hours coding without even realizing it.

I like strict and optimized languages, that's why my favorite language is rust.\
A contrario, I don't like languages like html or css wich are makeup and style languages

I usualy prefer using cli tools over gui tools because you don't have to leave your keyboard to use them and you can easily develop muscle memory with them.\
My main editor is [vim](https://www.vim.org/) because it feels nice to use and is very customizable.\
I often found myself wanting to split my terminal so I ended up setting my [zsh](https://www.zsh.org/) to automatically use [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki) when I open a terminal.\
Configuring my programs can easily take a lot of time, therefor I set up a [git repository](http://github.com/Rignchen/dotfile "Click here to see my configuration files") to store my dotfiles and use [stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/) to manage them.

When I'll be older I would like to work as a game developper or a low-level developper
